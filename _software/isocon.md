IsoCon is a tool for reconstructing highly similar sequences present in a dataset of from long noisy reads. Its original use case was transcripts on primer captured cDNA from highly similar gene copies. However the methodology extends also other types of sequencing data with known start and stop sites, such as primer captured genomic data.

Installation and user instructions are found on [Github page](https://github.com/ksahlin/IsoCon).
